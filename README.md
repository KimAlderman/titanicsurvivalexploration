# Titanic Survival Exploration
Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree project: exploring Titanic survival data

This was my first project in my Machine Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. Tools and techniques used in this project include:

* Jupyter/iPython notebook
* pandas, numpy, and visualization libraries for Python
* establishing baseline prediction to compare against model
* manual implementation of a decision-tree model

This was a great project-centered way to become familiar with Jupyter notebooks.
